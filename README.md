🤖 My name is Nachiket Soni and I'm a first year 
engineering student at DTU. I am interested in 
the lifecycle of a product, from the research that 
makes it possible, the engineering to make it real, 
to the business strategy to make it profitable. In 
the engineering field, I'm particularly drawn 
towards innovative infrastructure and mechanical 
systems.
